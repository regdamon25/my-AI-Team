AI Chat Assistant with Multiple Personalities
Welcome to our AI Chat Assistant repository! This project aims to create a versatile AI chat assistant that can be summoned through multiple bots, each exhibiting unique characteristics and capabilities in Slack.

Each bot - Lloyd, Esmee, Angel, Eliza, Evan, Blanton, and more - represents a unique persona with a specific set of skills and functions. Whether it's assistance in formulating marketing strategies, offering tech support, or facilitating tasks in various domains, each bot offers a tailored experience to users.

The AI chat assistant is developed using Python, Flask, the Slack API, and OpenAI's advanced language model, GPT-4.

Key features:

Multiple chat bots, each with a unique persona and capabilities.
Context-aware conversation flow using the GPT-4 model.
Seamless integration with Slack for real-time user interaction.
Extensible design for easy addition of new bots/personas.
Error handling to ensure a consistent user experience.
To get started with this project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies and follow the steps outlined in our detailed setup guide.
